# Issues

* vue and vanilla clients are integrated in a dynamic way but need to make server more intelligent about selecting which development client is desired.
* react client not integrated.
* server is very rudimentary, needs upgrades.

## 0.1.13

* Haven't linked the postcss-config.json file to the react-client webpack.config.json file.
* At this point the react and vue clients are writing their distributions in an awkward manner, needs an integration solution.
* I've made the vendor folder ignored by git so it needs to be generated ahead of time.
