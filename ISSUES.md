# Issues

* Haven't linked the postcss-config.json file to the react-client webpack.config.json file.
* At this point the react and vue clients are writing their distributions in an awkward manner, needs an integration solution.
* I've made the vendor folder ignored by git so it needs to be generated ahead of time.
